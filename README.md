# Connect 4 Game

## A simple game where you play Connect 4™ against yourself

### TODO

- The Connect 4 board is 7 spaces wide and 6 spaces high
- The player’s token must fall to the bottom of the column they place it into
- You cannot play into a full column
- You win by getting 4 tokens in a row (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)
- How cool would it be to program a computer player using artificial inteligence
- Animations, drag and drop, or other advanced UX could also be fun additions
